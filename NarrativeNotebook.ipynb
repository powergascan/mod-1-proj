The vast majority of movies have performance somewhere between being slightly unprofitable and making about two and a half times their budget, while there is always a small percentage of movies each year that make ten, twenty, or even hundreds times their budget. This huge variability in profitability also affects the asymetrical appearance of the chart; you can only lose what you put into a movie production, but the potential profit doesn't have a hard upper limit. We will center our strategy around trying to take advantage of this asymmetry and variability."

    "  * For example, a movie that costs \\\\$200M to make would need to make \\\\$20 Billion to make 100 times the initial investment.\n",
    "2. Focusing on lower-budget films allows us to have granular controll over our risk and spending since because the distribution is so asymetric, the potential loss from any one film is very small. \n",
    "  * Instead of choosing whether to make one or two \\\\$200M movies, we can choose more specifically how much to spend.\n",
    "3. In order to take maximum advantage of the high variability of profitability we should make as many lower-budget films as possible to increase our chances of success.\n",

    "Our first avenue of investigation was to look at level of competition movies faced and how that affected their profitability. We also broke this down into Mass Production and Independant movies, because more expensive movies are more often large studio productions, and independant movies tend to have smaller budgets. What this graph shows us is very usefull. We can see that as we increase the amount of competition, the profitability of independant movies severely decreases, while big budget movies are far less affected. Importantly, the *variability* of the independant movie profitability is also decreased, which is very important to our strategy. We suspect this is due to the efficiency of scale and large budgets for advertising enjoyed by elarge, expensive studio productions.  \n",

    "Similarly to the competition graph, we see different behavior here for mass production and independant movies. The profitability for mass production movies is almost unaffected by market condition, while the median and the variability of the profitability is severely decreased for independant movies when consumer sentiment is low. So independant movies are also much more sensitive to consumer sentiment than mass porduction movies. We suspect this is because when consumer sentiment is low and people have less spending money they are more likely to choose large studio movies that are more familiar to them from advertising and brand loyalty.  \n",
