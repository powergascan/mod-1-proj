# Module 1: on Market Segmentation and Movie Profitability
## Group C: William Sundstrom and Xin Xue 

In this project, we examine movies' profitability at different segment of the market: independent versus mass produced movies. Our study focuses on two-three dimensions. First, how does industry competition at the time of a movie's release affect its profitability. Second, how does the additional disposable income impact a movie's profitability. Finally, can we observe some seasonality for movie releases and profitability. From these dimensions, we propose several recommendations to our clients on what segment they should focus on and when they should release their products.
