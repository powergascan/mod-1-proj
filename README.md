# Module 1: on Market Segmentation and Movie Profitability
## Group C: William Sundstrom and Xin Xue 

In this project, we examine movies' profitability at different segments of the market: independent versus mass produced movies. Our study focuses on three dimensions. First, how does industry competition at the time of a movie's release affect its profitability? Second, how does the consumer sentiment measured by stock market returns impact a movie's profitability? Finally, can we observe some seasonality between movie releases and their profitability? From these dimensions, we propose several recommendations to our clients on what segment they should focus on and when they should release their products.
